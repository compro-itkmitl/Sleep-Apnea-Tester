# Sleep Apnea Tester
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep Apnea Tester is a micro-controller project for Computer Programming 2017 with two main objectives are Sleep Apnea surveillance and report irregularity statistics while sleeping.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the problem in sleeping was increase and these problems can risk assessment in diseases. Sleep Apnea Tester can solve sleep problem by respiratory rate measure, snore check and others while sleeping with Sound Microphone Detection Module. The statistics will be saved and can be checking to signify irregularity while sleeping if the irregularity was found while sleeping, the user can consult with paramedic for protecting in long term.
